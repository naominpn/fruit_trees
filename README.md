# Fruit Tree finder - building our first Full-stack application in a small team. 

[FRUIT FINDER LINK](https://multicultural-leaf-99080.herokuapp.com/)

## Summary
The Fruit Finder web-based application solves the issue of locating freely available fruit and vegetables that are publically accessible. 

The application allows users to find freely available fruit trees in their area. A user can create an account and add fruit tree locations. The locations are added to the map and can then be viewed by other users. If a user has an account they are able to like and comment on different fruit trees. 

The app was built using Node JS and the Express JS framework to enable the server-side and Client-side to be written in JavaScript. The application utlisies the Google Maps API inorder to display and locate fruit tree locations on a map.

We used the following dependencies to assist in both development and production. 
- bcrypt -> password encryption library 
- dotenv -> moduled used to access environemnt variables within in Node JS
- express -> used to create server framework and the application API. 
- express-session -> module to create session middleware. 
- lodash -> JavaScript library used to write more concise scripts. 
- morgan -> HTTP request logger middleware fro Node JS
- pg -> Node Js module used to interface with the PostgreSQL database.
